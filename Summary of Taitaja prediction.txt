TAITAJA PELITUOTANTO – SUMMARY (2019–2025) & 2026 PREDICTION
==========================================================

This document summarizes recurring patterns in the Taitaja Pelituotanto competition
based on tasks from 2019–2025 and provides a grounded prediction for 2026.

----------------------------------------------------------
GENERAL STRUCTURE (CONSISTENT EVERY YEAR)
----------------------------------------------------------
The competition follows the same structure every year:

Task 1 – Concept / Planning
- Short design or concept task
- Usually 15–20% of total score

Task 2 – Game Development
- Main task, usually 55–60% of total score
- This task decides most rankings

Task 3 – Presentation
- Final presentation and demo
- Usually around 20% of total score

This structure is extremely stable and is expected to remain unchanged in 2026.

----------------------------------------------------------
TASK 1 – CONCEPT / PLANNING
----------------------------------------------------------
Typical requirements:
- Game idea and genre
- Target audience
- Core mechanics
- How the given theme affects gameplay

Common mistakes:
- Overly large or unrealistic ideas
- Spending too much time writing instead of planning

What scores well:
- Simple, realistic concepts
- Clear connection to the theme
- Games that are clearly possible to finish in the given time

Prediction for 2026:
- A client brief or theme-based assignment
- Short written concept or slides
- Focus on clarity, not length

----------------------------------------------------------
TASK 2 – GAME DEVELOPMENT (MOST IMPORTANT)
----------------------------------------------------------
Common expectations every year:
- Functional player controls
- Clear gameplay loop
- Win and/or lose conditions
- User interface explaining controls or status
- Score, health, timer, or progress system
- At least one challenge (enemy, obstacle, puzzle, time pressure)
- Audio (music and/or sound effects)
- Stable performance on Windows PC

Key observation:
A small, complete, polished game consistently scores higher
than a large but unfinished or buggy project.

Engine trends:
- Unity (especially 2D) is the most practical and common choice
- Judges focus on gameplay and usability, not advanced technology

----------------------------------------------------------
TASK 3 – PRESENTATION
----------------------------------------------------------
Judges expect:
- Clear explanation of the game
- Slides that match the game visually
- Explanation of mechanics and theme
- Short demo or video
- Understandable English

Common issues:
- Weak structure
- Poor explanation of design choices
- Lack of preparation

----------------------------------------------------------
OVERALL PATTERNS (2019–2025)
----------------------------------------------------------
- Tasks emphasize clarity, usability, and completeness
- UI and player feedback are important
- Accessibility and readability matter
- Complex systems are not required to score well

----------------------------------------------------------
2026 PREDICTION
----------------------------------------------------------
Very likely:
- Unity-compatible task
- 2D or simple 3D game
- Theme or client-based assignment
- Strong focus on UI and player understanding

Very unlikely:
- Multiplayer or networking
- Large 3D open-world projects
- Procedural generation
- Mobile or web-specific deployment

----------------------------------------------------------
PREPARATION STRATEGY
----------------------------------------------------------
Effective preparation includes:
- A reusable script toolkit (movement, UI, enemies, scoring, etc.)
- Understanding what each script does at a high level
- Ability to adapt existing scripts to new tasks
- Clear presentation structure prepared in advance

This approach aligns well with competition expectations.
